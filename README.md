# Bank-Loan-Analysis-Report
## **Project Overview: Bank Loan Performance Analytics**

In this project, I leveraged my Data Analytics skills using Power BI to create three interactive dashboards that provide insights into a bank's loan performance. These dashboards focus on key metrics, trends, loan classifications, and financial performance, helping to analyze and understand loan applications, funded amounts, interest rates, and borrower behaviors.

1. **Summary Dashboard**:
    - Highlighted key metrics such as total loan applications, funded and received amounts, and month-over-month growth.
    - Provided insights into loan classifications (Good vs. Bad Loans) and the current loan status analysis (current, charged-off, and fully paid loans).
    - Key insights included growth trends and risk mitigation recommendations.
2. **Overview Dashboard**:
    - Provided a high-level summary of loan applications with insights into monthly trends, geographic distribution (state-wise), loan terms, and borrower characteristics.
    - Key insights included growth in loan applications, preferences for shorter loan terms, and borrower segmentation.
3. **Details Dashboard**:
    - Offered a detailed breakdown of individual loan records, segmented by purpose, home ownership, loan grades, and financial metrics.
    - Insights focused on debt consolidation as the dominant loan purpose, interest rate variations, and loan repayment correlations.
